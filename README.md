Module 6 Weather Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to show the ability to pull API data from open weather and also google.  In addition to manipulate the data in order to get the weather from a random selection of lat and long.  A heat map was created along with map markers to show cities based off a selection criteria of min and max temperatures.  From this information, nearby hotels within 3 milesn from the random selection of lat and long was added.  Finally the project ends with a selection of 4 near by cities and creating a route.
